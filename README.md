Exploring Software Defined Networking

Using virtual network in Mininet and deployed on Google Cloud Platform


For making customized network created a binary tree structured network with 7 switches namely S1...7 and hosts H1...H8. Atached switches with hosts using links.


Exploration divided into tasks : 

Tested to transfer of 100 packages from H1 -> H2 with 1 switch inbetween

Tested to transfer of 100 packages from H1 -> H8 with 5 switches inbetween

Testing speed between two hosts namely H1 -> H2 in unit Mbits/sec

Testing speed between two hosts namely H1 -> h8 in unit Mbits/sec

Checking Traffic in all switches S1...S7

Running pingall to verify connectivity and dump the output
